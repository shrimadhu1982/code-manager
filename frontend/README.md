# Code Snippet Manager – Mini Project

## Problem Statement
Developers often struggle to store and quickly retrieve useful code snippets.
Existing tools do not provide a simple, lightweight way to save and manage
code snippets during development.

## Proposed Solution
This project is a simple full-stack Code Snippet Manager that allows users to
log in and store reusable code snippets through a clean web interface.

## Features
- User login (demo authentication)
- Add and view code snippets
- Frontend and backend separation
- REST API based communication

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (React)
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Storage: In-memory storage (demo mode)

## How to Run
1. Start backend  
   `node index.js`

2. Start frontend  
   `npm run dev`

3. Open browser  
   `http://localhost:3000`



## Conclusion
This mini-project demonstrates full-stack development concepts including
frontend-backend interaction, REST APIs, and basic authentication flow.
